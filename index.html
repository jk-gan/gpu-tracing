**GPU Tracing**

The book will guide you through the building blocks of a GPU-based renderer
using the same step-by-step approach in Ray Tracing In One Weekend. The goal is
not to build a fully-featured and highly optimized real-time renderer; rather,
it is to show you how to translate the concepts introduced in Ray Tracing In One
Weekend into a design that is practical to port to all modern GPU platforms
while paying attention to some of the common pitfalls of GPU programming.
